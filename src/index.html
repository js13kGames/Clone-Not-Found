        Can you handle the teleportation manually until I find Greg?
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems that in every group teleportation, one of the clone is missing. You have
        to tell the pad which one is it. It's easy, since the clones like to wear
        matching outfits.

      <p>
        Also, Greg always bregs about his score. Knock it down. That will show
        him.<span>&#128170&#128513</span>
